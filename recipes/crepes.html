    <h2>Classic French Crepes</h2>
    <p>This basic batter recipe for crÃªpes and pancakes is a versatile foundation for either sweet or savoury fillings
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>


        <li>140g plain flour</li>
        <li>200ml whole milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>25g unsalted butter, melted, plus a little extra for greasing</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Sift the flour with a pinch of salt into a medium-size bowl and make a well in the middle. Mix the milk and
            100ml of water together. Break the eggs into the well and start whisking slowly. Add the milk and water in a
            steady stream, whisking constantly and gradually incorporating the flour as you do so.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk until the batter is smooth and all the flour has been incorporated. Set the batter aside to rest for
            30 mins, then whisk the melted butter into the batter.</li>

        <li> Heat the pan over a medium heat. Very lightly grease the pan with melted butter. Using a ladle, pour
            roughly 2
            tbsp of batter into the pan and swirl it around so the bottom of the pan is evenly coated. You want to use
            just
            enough batter to make a delicate, lacy pancake. Cook the pancake for about 45 secs on one side until golden
            and
            then using a palette knife or fish slice, flip the pancake over and cook the other side for about 30 secs
            until
            it freckles.</li>
        <li>
            Slide the pancake out of the pan and either serve immediately or stack on a plate with baking parchment in
            between. Continue until all the batter is used up.</li>


    </ol>
